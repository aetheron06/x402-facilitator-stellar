/**
 * Deliberately small.
 *
 * This is a five-file service whose job is to be a thin, readable transport
 * over @x402/stellar. Importing a forty-rule preset into it would generate
 * churn that has nothing to do with correctness, and would make the diff on a
 * conformance fix harder to read. The rules here are the ones that catch real
 * mistakes in this codebase: unused bindings left behind by a refactor, and
 * accidental globals.
 *
 * Formatting is Prettier's job and is checked separately, so nothing here
 * concerns itself with whitespace.
