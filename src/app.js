/**
 * The HTTP surface: /verify, /settle, /supported, /usage, /discovery/resources,
 * /healthz, /health/ready.
 *
 * @x402/core ships no facilitator router — it gives you x402Facilitator with
 * verify(), settle() and getSupported(), and the transport is yours. This file
 * is that transport and nothing else.
 *
 * Conformance is judged at the wire level (RFP §3.6): reviewers point stock SDK
 * code at the deliverable rather than read a conformance claim. So the rules
 * here are narrow and deliberate:
 *
 *   - the spec's `payload: {transaction}` shape is accepted verbatim, unwrapped
 *     and un-renamed;
 *   - every rejection carries a non-null reason code, including transport-level
 *     ones, so an agent can branch on a code instead of parsing prose;
 *   - responses are passed through from the scheme untouched.
 *
 * Transport (#119): Fastify rather than Express. The routing/parsing core is
 * what showed up in load profiling at high RPS; Fastify's schema-compiled
 * handlers and lower-allocation JSON path address exactly that. Every behaviour
 * the wire contract had is preserved: status codes, reason codes, response
 * shapes and headers are byte-for-byte what they were under Express — the
 * framework changed, the surface did not.
 *
 * Body validation is Fastify's built-in AJV compiler with `attachValidation`:
 * schemas reject structurally impossible bodies before any handler code runs,
 * but the handler still shapes the rejection, because /verify and /settle
 * disagree on what a failure body looks like (isValid/invalidReason vs.
 * success/errorReason/transaction/network) and AJV must not flatten that.
 *
 * Separated from server.js so the surface can be built and exercised without
 * binding a port, holding a real signer, or spawning a subprocess. server.js is
 * the process entrypoint and does nothing this file does.
